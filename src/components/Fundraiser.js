                <p>This is the First of its Kind.  We are doing a different type of event. Not your typical one.
    Setting precedence. We are engaging alumni from other schools to help push this as
    the First Inaugural/Annual Maintenance Fundraiser for Legacy Schools.</p>
                <p>Every school has issues with disrepair and finding ways to raise money to fix. This
    approach off combined fund raising takes care of that in a bigger more material way.</p>
                <p>We are raising money to refurbish all 9 houses at our school. Our cost is ~360,000
    GHS, just our year group alone has raised close to ~150,000 GHS and we are pleased
    to announce that work has commenced, and we would like to have all works done by
    March of 2020. So, we are looking to raise the shortfall.</p>
                <p>Since we the 79 HOPSANS are planning and hosting the first event, we will be the
    recipient of the first raise, but the event is targeting ALL Legacy SHS schools to be
    recipients on a yearly or bi-annual rotational basis.</p>
                <p>We will announce next year’s recipient at this year’s event. We will hand off to another
    school next year but assist because we will now have the template for the event.</p>
                <p>That is why the ticket price is what it is and the event despite keeping costs down is
    going to be fantastic. - we are really making it a night to remember!</p>
                <p>We are planning to have two separate events (this dinner dance on 26th October and
    an Interco on 19th October (details to come soon).</p>
                <p>We are also inviting noteworthy VIPs who were in some of the legacy schools at the
    time. We are trying to raise a lot of money in one fell swoop and we feel this is the best
    way to do that. COLLECTIVELY!</p>
                <p>We hope you will purchase a ticket and come join us for a wonderful Trip down memory
    lane for a great cause.</p>
