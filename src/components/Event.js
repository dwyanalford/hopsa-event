                    <p>Please join us for the party of the year in the year of the return. Celebrating ourselves, locals, returnees and Diasporans that graced the hallowed halls of our legacy high schools during those fabled years of the late 70’s -early 80’s.</p>
<p>We are making it the biggest reunion of our era – celebrating our time in school, long vacs – sitting on the Aquinas wall, bus stop, nibbles, pop chain, Orion and Rex cinemas, Cave, Keteke, even Black Caesar! Then to circle or Osu for Chofi, Domedo and Kelewele.</p>
<p>Come and let us assault your senses and take you back in time, to a place that was idyllic and euphoric and such a part of who we were and still are.</p>
<p>All for a good cause (this year Holyco refurbshment of all houses), next year (SHS recipient to be announced) and keep our legacies alive.</p>
<p>We promise you it will be “oh what a night” – “a night to remember”!</p>
<p>Meet me there!</p>
